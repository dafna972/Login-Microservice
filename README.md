WHOAMI
Hi, I'm Dafna.
When I do things, I do them correctly. No matter if it's getting married, speaking new language or - coding. First I set up a goal. Then I  consider my steps and get ready. Along the way, I make sure to get the most out of the journey.
I know Python. I wrote a Django login micro-service. My goal - publishing it to GitHub. The easy way - do it. My way - read about structure, read about testing. Think how to turn it into a unique app that I would feel connected to. Implement everything I read. Polish my code with a clean code tutorial. Consult my community. And my mentor. Get feedback and take it  into account.
That's who I am. Can't wait to share the results with you.
